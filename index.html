                    Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                    place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                    considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or
                    apprenticeship. of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education
                    in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations

                    The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples,
                    Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,[10] and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research.[11] Founded in 1088, the University of
                    Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.[12] Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, Islamic science and mathematics flourished under the Islamic caliphate which was established across the Middle
                    East, extending from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus in the east and to the Almoravid Dynasty and Mali Empire in the south. The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation
                    of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy,

                    The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person ",[6] or "the art of strengthening or bringing up
                    men ".[7] This was a broad
                    conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class
                    and gender.[8] There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face. "[7] These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation
                    the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.[7] After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship
                    in Western Europe.[9] The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's
                    modern universities.[4] During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School.
